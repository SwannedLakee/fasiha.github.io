## About Ahmed Fasih

The blog title comes from Professor Richard Hamming’s motto, “The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers” ([SIAM](http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=893)).

I sling JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, and friends, for fun and profit. After enjoying programming for years, I discovered applied math in mid-undergrad, and through various adventures in grad school and industry, I wound up learning a lot about signal processing, machine learning, and scientific computing.

When I’m not writing code or applying math, I enjoy studying the languages and literatures of the Japanese, Chinese, Greek, and Indian civilizations.
