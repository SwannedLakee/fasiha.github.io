  </ul><h1>A look at S&P 500's real excess return over Treasuries</h1><p><em>Updated on Sun, 08 Nov 2020 03:01:01 GMT, tagged with ‘finance’.</em></p><blockquote>
<p><strong>2021 Feb 10 Update</strong> Earlier versions of this essay were, as many thought, plagued with a <a href="https://github.com/fasiha/shiller-heat/commit/b9b49b4fb14edf41303b27dabd63c9eef640d8b8">bug</a> that severely underestimated long-term returns. A thousand apologies! The rest of this essay has been compressed to summarize the updated (and hopefully correct) findings.</p>

<p>Imagine. It's 1871. A promising young American has just entered the workforce and makes it a point to buy $100 of the S&amp;P 500 index every month, with dividends reinvested, over a forty year career. It's now 1911. Our American, about to retire, stops these monthly purchases and asks, "What is the real return I achieved in excess of risk-free Treasuries over my forty-year investing horizon?" <strong><em>Answer: 3.6%.</em></strong></p>
<p>Imagine now that every year after 1871, we can find one such promising young American to join the work force and to do the same thing: monthly-dollar-cost average into the S&amp;P 500 index for forty years.</p>
<p>And similarly, for not just forty years, but for other time horizons.</p>
<p>The plot below shows the real excess return of the S&amp;P 500 over risk-free Treasuries for a few time horizons, from ten to a hundred years. Thanks to Plotly, it's interactive so you can click, tap, zoom, pan, pinch, etc. You can turn off a line you don't want to see by clicking or tapping it in the legend.</p>

<p>Some nerdy details: Robert Shiller's <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm">online dataset</a> contains monthly numbers for the S&amp;P 500 index's price (dollars per share), dividends (dollars per month), and 10-year Treasury yields, all starting in 1871. I assume you invested $1 at the beginning of each month, reinvesting the dividends that accrued over the previous month. After 480 such buying sessions (for forty year horizons), I calculate the internal rate of return (XIRR) by assuming the entire portfolio was liquidated, which is just an accounting choice to answer the question, "what real return did the S&amp;P 500 yield over this forty year horizon after monthly dollar cost averaging".</p>
<p>I then do a similar exercise with Treasuries: every month I assume you put that $1 into a savings account-like vehicle that pays interest monthly at the same rate as the 10-year T-note's. XIRR again computes the internal rate of return, over the same time horizon. <em>Excess</em> return is just the S&amp;P's real return minus the Treasuries' real return, and is expressed in a percentage just like any rate of return. Because inflation aflicts stocks and bonds equally, <em>excess</em> return is also the <strong><em>real</em></strong> <em>excess return</em>. (You can inspect the TypeScript <a href="https://github.com/fasiha/shiller-heat/blob/3e46bdc6d268f9fb6290328373d1a2942f2a2e7e/shiller.ts#L120-L124">code</a>.)</p>

For example, T-bonds in 2013 are shown to have -9.1% return but we see from <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS30">DGS30 Fed time series</a> that during 2013, the constant maturity rate for thirty-year bonds was between 2.8% and 3.9%. (Damodaran's annual returns for the three-month T-bills seems to jibe well with the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS3MO">Fed's DGS3MO</a> numbers though, and might be an acceptable proxy for the ten-year T-note yields in <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm">Shiller</a>'s dataset.)</p>
